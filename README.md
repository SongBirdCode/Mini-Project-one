# <Mini-Project-One>

## Description

 Creating a landing page utilizing HTML and CSS that meet all acceptance criteria.

 My goal was my landing page to utilize an accessible UI, a contact form that may collect a visitor's contact information, an image with a caption, an appropriate header and footer, at least three different colors, and a single font and font family for all text. 


## Installation

I created this landing page though visual code. 
After multiple research and layering of what has been learned through our lessons and on our resources, I saved my results, ensured I have the correct folders required so HTML and CSS are linked and communicate clearly. I then ensured a README.md file is created and filled out prior to deployment of my landing page to GitHub. 

## Usage

All materials should be present within repository. 

## Credits

All contributions are from me, github.com/songbirdcode.

All can be adjusted as required as I continue to learn and grow. As we face more group projects, I will add more here. 

I used sources from reading developer.mozilla.org, learn.shayhowe.com, w3schools.com, along with materials presented within our bootcamp.
